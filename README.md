DAY 29 


Unicode is a standard for storing and representing text, which at first glance you might think sounds easy.

But it really isn’t.

The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on.

Along the way you’ll meet List, onAppear(), Bundle, fatalError(), and more – all useful skills that you’ll use for years to come. You’ll also get some practice with @State, NavigationView.
